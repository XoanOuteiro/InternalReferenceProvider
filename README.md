# Internal Reference Provider
A way to get a little more coverage when trying to discover directories on web bug bounties and penetration tests

---
## Usage disclaimer:
This tool is meant ONLY for use in domains which you are allowed to test and scan, while this program
requests only a very limited ammount of times it is still by all means an automated scanner.

This tool was made to test webpages that allowed a 1req/sec automated scan traffic rate or more.

I do not support the usage of this tool with malicious intent.
